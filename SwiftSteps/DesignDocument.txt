# SwiftSteps - App Design & Feature Overview

## 1. App Concept & Purpose
**SwiftSteps** is a beginner-friendly, gamified learning application designed to teach the Swift programming language. Unlike traditional coding tutorials that can be overwhelming, SwiftSteps breaks down concepts into bite-sized, digestible lessons with a focus on safety, clarity, and positive reinforcement.

**Core Philosophy:**
- **No Pressure:** Learn at your own pace without rigorous deadlines.
- **Safety First:** Code execution is sandboxed. Users can "Run" code without fear of breaking the app.
- **Visual Progress:** Clear indicators of unlocked content and achievements.

## 2. Visual Style & Aesthetics
The app employs a "Calm & Clean" design language to reduce cognitive load for beginners.

- **Color Palette:**
  - **Primary:** A soft, encouraging main color (likely a friendly blue or purple, defined as `PrimaryColor`).
  - **Accent:** Used for interactive elements (buttons, progress bars).
  - **Surface/Background:** Clean off-white or light gray backgrounds to keep the focus on content.
  - **Status Colors:** Standard Green (Success), Red (Error), Orange (Warning) for feedback.
- **Typography:**
  - Uses system fonts (San Francisco) for familiarity and readability.
  - Clear hierarchy with large headings for topics and legible body text for explanations.
- **Layout:**
  - Spacious padding (standardized in `AppSpacing`) to avoid clutter.
  - specific "Card" style views for lessons and levels.

## 3. Architecture & Tech Stack
- **Framework:** SwiftUI (100% native declarative UI).
- **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).
  - **State Management:** centralized `AppStateViewModel` acts as the single source of truth, managing user progress, navigation, and data persistence.
  - **Data Flow:** Unidirectional. Views observe ViewModels, which mutate the Model.
- **Navigation:** `NavigationStack` with type-safe `NavigationRoute` enum for robust deep linking and state restoration.

## 4. Key Screens & Flow (Estimated 5-6 Main Screens)

### 1. Onboarding Screen
- **Purpose:** Welcomes new users and sets up their initial profile/preferences.
- **Visuals:** Simple, single-column layout with welcoming imagery and a clear "Get Started" call to action.

### 2. Home Screen (Dashboard)
- **Purpose:** The central hub. Shows current progress, daily streaks, or "Next Lesson" suggestions.
- **Visuals:**
  - Progress summary card.
  - Quick access to the current active level.
  - Tab bar or main navigation links to other sections.

### 3. Level Selection Screen
- **Purpose:** A map or list of all available levels (e.g., "Swift Basics", "Control Flow").
- **Visuals:**
  - **Locked/Unlocked States:** Visual feedback (padlock icons vs. bright colors) showing which levels are accessible.
  - **Progress Indicators:** Completion bars or checkmarks on level cards.

### 4. Lesson List Screen
- **Purpose:** Displays the individual lessons within a selected Level.
- **Visuals:**
  - Vertical list of lesson rows.
  - Icons indicating status: Locked (gray), Available (color), Completed (green check).
  - Clean typography showing lesson titles and brief descriptions.

### 5. Lesson Detail Screen (The Core Experience)
- **Purpose:** Where the actual learning happens.
- **Flow:**
  1.  **Theory:** Brief, easy-to-read text explaining a concept.
  2.  **Code Interaction:** A safe code editor or interactive block.
  3.  **Run & Output:** User taps "Run", causing a sheet or changing area to display the result.
  4.  **Success State:** Confetti or positive feedback modal upon correct completion.
- **Safety:** Sandboxed execution prevents crashes. "Scary" error messages are replaced with helpful hints.

### 6. Rewards / Profile Screen
- **Purpose:** showcase achievements to motivate the user.
- **Visuals:**
  - **Badge Grid:** A grid of unlockable badges.
  - **Earned:** Full color, satisfying visuals.
  - **Locked:** Silhouettes or grayscale versions with hints on how to unlock.

## 5. "Pros" of This Implementation
1.  **Crash-Resilient:** The "Safe Run" architecture means beginners can make mistakes without the app crashing or showing intimidating stack traces.
2.  **Scalable Content:** The data model (`Level`, `Lesson`) is decoupled from the UI, making it easy to add new production content (JSON/Data) without rewriting code.
3.  **Maintainable Code:** Strict MVVM separation ensures that UI logic doesn't bleed into business logic, making the codebase clean and easy to test.
4.  **Platform Citizen:** Uses native SwiftUI components, ensuring the app feels at home on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.
5.  **State Preservation:** Navigation state is saved, so users can return exactly where they left off.
