    SWIFTSTEPS - COMPLETE PROJECT PLAN
    Swift Student Challenge 2026
    ================================================================================

    PROJECT OVERVIEW
    ----------------
    Build a beginner-focused Swift learning app called "SwiftSteps" for the Swift 
    Student Challenge. The app teaches Swift and SwiftUI through small, calm, 
    interactive lessons.

    ==========================================

    1. PROJECT STRUCTURE DESIGN
    ------------------------
    Goal: Create clean, scalable folder organization
    
    Structure:
    - Models/ - Domain data models (Lesson, Level, Badge, UserProgress)
    - ViewModels/ - MVVM ViewModels (AppStateViewModel, LevelViewModel, etc.)
    - Views/ - All SwiftUI screens and UI components
        - Onboarding/
        - Home/
        - Levels/

        - Controls: app-wide progression, navigation state
        - Methods: loadInitialData(), unlockLevel(), markLessonComplete()
    
    b) LevelViewModel
        - Owns: current level, lessons in level
        - Controls: lesson unlocking logic, level completion
        - Methods: canAccessLesson(), completedLessonsCount()
    
    c) LessonViewModel
        - Owns: current lesson content, user answers
        - Controls: lesson execution, validation
        - Methods: submitAnswer(), executeCode(), validateQuiz()
    
    d) ProgressViewModel
        - Owns: calculated progress stats
        - Controls: XP calculations, badge checks
        - Methods: calculateTotalProgress(), checkBadgeEligibility()

    ----------------
    Goal: Translate state/logic into clear, calm UI with NavigationStack
    
    Screens to Build:
    
    a) Onboarding Flow
        - Welcome screen with app introduction
        - Feature highlights (3-4 cards)
        - "Start Learning" CTA

    PHASE 4: LEARNING FLOW UI
    ==========================

    6. DETAILED LEARNING FLOW
    ----------------------
    Goal: Create interconnected learning experience with state-driven navigation
    
    Five Interconnected Screens:
    
    a) Track Selection View
        - Choose Swift or SwiftUI track
        - Gate SwiftUI behind Swift Level 2 completion
        - Visual indication of locked state
    
    b) Level Selection View
        - Show all levels in track
        - LevelCard component for each level
        - Display lock/unlock/complete states
        - Tap to navigate to lesson list
    
    c) Lesson List View
        - All lessons in selected level
        - LessonRow component for each lesson
        - StateIndicator shows lock/unlock/complete
        - Sequential unlocking (complete previous to unlock next)
    
    d) Lesson Detail View
        - Full lesson content
        - CodeEditor for interactive practice
        - Quiz UI with validation
        - ProgressBar shows position in level
        - "Mark Complete" triggers state update
    
    e) Level Completion View
        - Celebration screen after completing all lessons
        - Shows badge if earned
        - XP gained summary
        - "Next Level" or "Back to Home" options

    Five Reusable Components:
    
    a) StateIndicator
        - Visual indicator for locked/unlocked/completed
        - Lock icon, checkmark, or empty circle
    
    b) LevelCard
        - Displays level info with progress
        - Shows number of lessons completed
        - Locked/unlocked visual styling
    
    c) LessonRow
        - Single lesson in list
        - Title, duration, state indicator
        - Tap to navigate to detail
    
    d) CodeEditor
        - Simple text editor for code practice
        - Syntax highlighting (basic)
        - "Run" button with output area
    
    e) ProgressBar
        - Linear progress indicator
        - Shows X of Y lessons completed


    PHASE 5: SAFETY & EDGE CASE HANDLING
    =====================================

    7. COMPREHENSIVE SAFETY MECHANISMS
    -------------------------------
    Goal: Ensure app never crashes, handles all edge cases gracefully
    
    Edge Cases to Handle:
    
    a) Data Edge Cases
        - Empty states: no lessons, no levels, no badges
        - Invalid IDs: lesson/level not found
        - Corrupted progress data
        - Solution: Validate all data, provide fallbacks, show empty state UI
    
    b) UI Edge Cases
        - Very long text (lesson titles, descriptions)
        - Small screens (iPhone SE)
        - Large text sizes (accessibility)
        - Landscape orientation
        - Solution: ScrollViews, text truncation, responsive layouts
    
    c) Lesson Execution Edge Cases
        - Code that doesn't compile
        - Infinite loops in user code
        - Quiz with no correct answer
        - Solution: Validation, timeouts, clear error messages
    
    d) Navigation Edge Cases
        - Back button pressed during lesson
        - Attempting to access locked content
        - Navigating while data is loading
        - Solution: Proper state checks, disabled buttons, loading states
    
    e) Accessibility Edge Cases
        - VoiceOver navigation
        - Screen reader announcements
        - Keyboard navigation
        - Solution: Accessibility labels, hints, proper semantic structure

    Error Handling Principles:
    - Never show technical errors to users
    - All messages human-readable and encouraging
    - Provide actionable next steps
    - Log errors for debugging (not shown to user)
    - Graceful degradation (show what works, hide what doesn't)


    PHASE 6: CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION
    ================================

    8. SWIFTUI UI IMPLEMENTATION
    -------------------------
    Goal: Create missing views, refine level completion flow, polish all screens
    
    Current Tasks:
    
    a) Create Missing Views
        - LearningPathView (track and level selection)
        - ProgressView (overall progress and badges)
    
    b) Refine Level Completion Flow
        - Polish LevelCompletionView
        - Smooth transitions and animations

    d) Ensure Complete Navigation
        - All screens accessible via NavigationStack
        - Back navigation works correctly
        - State updates reflect in UI immediately
